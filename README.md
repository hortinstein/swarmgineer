swarmgineer
============

Tool for outputting a JSON blueprint that serves as the  configuration file for a riak swarm.  

Blueprint can be made from scratch using prompts, or can be modified from a source JSON file.  Modifiers will eventually be accepted to handle creation and deletion of nodes or horizontal scaling.

Blueprints are fed into swarmlicator for actual node spinups.
